#ES 1 tic tac toe

#First i will import random into the code so I will be able to use it later.
#Then I will make a variable name "board", put an equal sig, then put brackens two times, and write the numbers 1-9, but every three press enter. 
#I will use the while True loop, so I dont have to put the code multiple times, with a : so everything underneath it is true or it will move on.
#After I will make a variable named players_choice, and make it an input to see what number the user wants.
#Then I will use board [players_choice] = x, becuase the user will be x 
#After i will make another variable named computers_choice = random.randint(1,9), that will be the computers choice.
#Then i will write [computers_choice] = O, becuase the computer is O
#After the board is full I will make an if statement, if 1,2,3 or 4,5,6 or 7,8,9, or 1,4,7 or 2,5,8 or 3,6,9 or 1,5,9 or 7,5,9 = x then the player wins and print win 
#but if  1,2,3 or 4,5,6 or 7,8,9, or 1,4,7 or 2,5,8 or 3,6,9 or 1,5,9 or 7,5,9 = O then the print loose 
#then i will put a break statment,
#but if non of the above happens, i will make and else statement printing tie
